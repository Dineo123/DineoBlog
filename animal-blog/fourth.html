     A trail runner who was gored by a bison at Antelope Island State Park in Utah in June decided to test his luck. After fully recovering, on Friday (Sept. 27), Kyler Bourgeous brought a date back to the park to watch the sunset â€” instead, in an odd twist of fate, his date also found herself facing the horns of a bison, according to recent news reports. 

"I thought my situation was just a freak accident," Bourgeous told The Washington Post.

Was it just that, a freak accident? And why do these large but seemingly harmless bearded beasts, gore people?

"It's actually really uncommon," said Wendy Wilson, an assistant park manager at the Antelope Island State Park, which is home to around 700 bison. In the past decade, about 4 million people have visited the park, with just five bison incidents. So it's "unusual" that there were two serious attacks just this year that sent people to the hospital, she added.
